    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>I wanted the richness of long-simmered chicken stew, but without the fuss of using a whole chicken. This compromise, using boneless skinless chicken thighs with bone-in chicken breast, gave me the richness of flavor and ease of preparation I was looking for! It's basically chicken pot pie made in a pressure cooker rather than an oven.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced carrot</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced celery</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 pound bone-in chicken breasts, skin removed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon thyme (Optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen petite peas</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen cut green beans</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Dumplings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the olive oil into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant PotÂ®) and select the Saute function. Cook onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf until the vegetables are soft and the onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chicken broth, chicken thighs, chicken breasts, thyme, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 9 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Carefully remove the chicken pieces with tongs and place them in a bowl to cool slightly; discard bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Mash butter with the flour to make a smooth paste; set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl for the dumplings. Cut in cold butter until mixture is the texture of cornmeal. Stir in parsley and set aside.</li>
        <li>Shred cooled chicken and return to the pot. Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning if needed. Add peas and green beans. Stir in the flour-butter paste. Select Saute function to bring broth back to a boil.</li>
        <li>Pour buttermilk into the dumpling mixture and stir until combined. Drop the dumpling dough by heaping spoonfuls on top of the stew; a small cookie scoop works well.</li>
        <li>Cover pot with the lid, leaving the steam vent open. Select Slow Cooker function and simmer on Low, covered, until dumplings are cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. A skewer inserted in the center of a dumpling should come out clean.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
    <p>If you want to use this as a pot pie filling, decrease the chicken broth to 2 cups.</p>
    <p>If you have a mini food processor, it's perfect for step 5. Transfer the flour-butter mixture to a bowl before proceeding.</p>
