This README.md file pertains to the 'Recipes' HTML Website Project (found in the Foundations section of The Odin Project). 

This Recipes Website consists of an index.html document (homepage) which will link to three (3) seperate recipe pages. 

Each recipe page consists of the following: 
- Image file 
- Headers
- Brief Descriptions
- Unordered List of Ingredients
- Ordered List of Steps to follow 

The following skills will have been demonstrated upon completion of the website:
- HTML Boilerplate 
- HTML elements (headers, paragraphs, ordered lists, unordered lists, anchors, etc)
- Git Workflow (CRITICAL) e.g. git status, git add, git commit -m, git log, git push origin main
